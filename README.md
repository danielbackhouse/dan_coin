# Pathetic Coin
Here is an unsecure (and insecure) cryptocurrency I created (whilst having my hand held by the greatest set of tutorial videos I've ever seen). Come join me and steal fake money from each other, make yourself a fake millionaire, and do other fake things to my blockchain. But if you do them, let me know what you did! I'm interested to learn about ways to improve on this, not just security but overall functionality and encourage people to both break and provide feedback on the work here.

Pathetic coin will soon be released in a python verison, pythetic-coin. So there's also that too look forward to.

I am also always running a node of this blockchain on my personal windows (don't get too excited about hacking my accounts there its a completely wiped device aside from the neccesary dependcies to run the node itself).

Dependencies for this project include:
